## 👨‍💻 Creator's Note
Hi, I’m Mashhood — a quant-focused analyst and tool-builder passionate about blending stats with design. I created **Modulus** to make statistical workflows easier, especially for students, policy researchers, and early-career data professionals. I’ve also authored two books and love turning complex analysis into clean, intuitive experiences.

> 💡 Whether you're running regressions or just exploring trends — Modulus helps you focus on the insights, not the syntax.

I created Modulus to simplify the workflow of data modeling — letting the interface handle the heavy lifting so users can focus on insights.
